 * in your app. By default, new applications are set up to include the Sencha Touch CSS file from
 * lib/touch/resources/css/ext-touch.css.
 * 
 * If you want to build a stripped-down version of the Sencha Touch CSS, remove that include from your
 * index.html file and uncomment the code below. This will then build the required elements of Sencha 
 * Touch's CSS along with your own SCSS code below into a single file.
 * 
 * This line must remain
 * @import 'sencha-touch/default/all';
 * 
 * Any of these lines can be removed/commented to remove those CSS rules from the generated file

/**
 * Using the supplied Sencha SCSS functions:
 * 
 * 1) Change the base color for your entire app (requires building Sencha Touch CSS yourself - see top of file)
 *     $base_color: #f58942;
 * 
 * This sets the whole theme to be based on an orange color
 * 
 * 2) Including more icons:
 * 
 *     @include sencha-toolbar-icon('nonDefaultIcon');
 *     @include sencha-toolbar-icon('someOtherIcon');
 * 
 * 3) To create a new Toolbar ui style:
 * 
 *     @include sencha-toolbar-ui('orange', #f58942, 'glossy');
 * 
 *     In your code:
 *     new Ext.Toolbar({ui: 'orange'});
